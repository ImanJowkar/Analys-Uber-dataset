## All code in this project has done by r language
In this project, I want to show you The Importance of data visualization.
Imagine you are a data scientist in an online taxi company, and your manager has a problem with three questions:
* - what times in a day the peak demand occurs?
* - what days in a week the peak demand occurs?
* - what days in a month the peak demand occur?
